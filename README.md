# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

This is a portfolio of work to showcase my skills to employers

## User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Approach
In order to meet the acceptance criteria, i used the Acceptance Criteria as a guide for how i will plan my deadlines, sketch, and code for my portfolio.


## Completed tasks
Below is a list of task completed:
- I have created a website with my name, a avatar image, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
- A link in the navigation, navigates to the corresponding section
- The link to the section about my work to view a section with titled images of my applications
- The first application, is larger in size than the other application
- Click on any of the application images to be taken to the deployed application
- When resizing the page or view of the site on various screens and devices you can see the responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.


## Important note
I only have one deployed application (First project: Horiseon).

The rest of the projects are linked to google.com


## Conclusion
In conclusion, building a portfolio page is an essential task that will help students showcase their skills and attract potential employers. Having several deployed projects is crucial to receive an initial interview at many companies, and a well-structured portfolio can significantly increase the chances of getting hired. The provided user story and acceptance criteria provide critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that meets a hiring manager's needs. By following these criteria, students can create an effective portfolio that demonstrates their strengths and thought processes behind their work.
